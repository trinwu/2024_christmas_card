                    <p>Kev! It has been such a joy getting to know you these past few years, and what an even greater blessing it's been to be able to witness the growth in your faith and serve alongside you. It has been so encouraging seeing you step up and out of your comfort zone. Despite how much you joke about it, you have really put yourself out there to get to know the brothers and sisters of our fellowship, and I see how much you genuinely and intentionally care for them. You've done such a great job leading men's ministry and building up your small group leaders. You are such a light to so many people. I'm truly grateful for all the times you check up on me and your willingness in offering help for whatever it may be. Conversations with you are always so insightful and life-giving. I pray that God continues to strengthen and grow you and use you to show those around you Christ's love. Continue seeking Him first in all that you do, and I can't wait to hear about all the wonderful ways He'll work in your life. May your winter break be full of love and laughter :D<br>Philippians 1:20</p>
