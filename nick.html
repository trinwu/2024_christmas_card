                    <p>Nick! I've said it before, but I'm so blessed and grateful to have such a faithful brother in Christ like you in my life. In the past year that I've known you, you have grown so much in your faith and in your love for others. I know it's not easy and it can be frustrating, but you are doing such a great job. You make everyone feel so welcome and have really stepped up to be a reliable, loving older brother to everyone in this fellowship, helping them to grow in their faith. I truly admire your heart for serving God, your heart to seek righteousness even when it's difficult and uncomfortable. What a wonderful example of Christ's love and servanthood. Thank you for all the fun, intentional conversations. It's friendships like this that remind me of God's continual provision in my life. Thank you for being a brother whom I can share my burdens with, who builds me up, who keeps me accountable, who admonishes me, and who helps me strive to love God more than I had before. I pray that you never stop striving for God's righteousness. Let's continue helping each other to become ever closer to the new creation God intended for us to be. I can't wait to hear about all the amazing ways God will challenge you and grow you this year. Continue seeking His glorious kingdom, showing Christ's love to all those around you! May your winter break be full of love and laughter :D<br>James 1:2-4</p>
